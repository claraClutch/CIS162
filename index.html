    <p>Hi my name is Clara Gomez and I am taking this class 
        because I am an aspiring software developer. I have had 
        a few career changes in my life due to my enjoyment of learning 
        and growth. This is actually my second time taking classes at Cerritos. 
        I attended in 2013 and 2014 while playing on the womenâ€™s soccer team 
        until I transferred to the University of Idaho for soccer and my 
        Bachelors of Science degree. I currently work in biopharmaceutical
        manufacturing on developing cancer therapies. I very much enjoy my career,
        but I am looking forward to developing my programming skills 
        and thinking more like a developer. </p>
