    <h1>Clara Gomez</h1>
    <p>Hi my name is Clara Gomez and I am taking this class 
        because I am an aspiring software developer. I have had 
        a few career changes in my life due to my enjoyment of learning 
        and growth. This is actually my second time taking classes at Cerritos. 
        I attended in 2013 and 2014 while playing on the womenâ€™s soccer team 
        until I transferred to the University of Idaho for soccer and my 
        Bachelors of Science degree. I currently work in biopharmaceutical
        manufacturing on developing cancer therapies. I very much enjoy my career,
        but I am looking forward to developing my programming skills 
        and thinking more like a developer. </p>


    <h1>When I have free time</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>I like to play with my dog</li>
        <li>Build puzzles with my mom</li>
        <li>BBQ and Smoke Meats</li>
    </ul>

    <p>My favorite website is <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/">teslarati</a> because I like tesla the company
        and I would like to build a website like this one.</p>
